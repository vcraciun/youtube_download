So i'm going to tell you today about a way of looking at the world that i think is substantially different from the way that most people look at the world and the way i want to tell you about looking at the world today is i think more inclusive than a standard sort of materialist view of the standard scientific view of the world of course is that it's made up of familiar objects and that the world is in essence of material place but there's some very.
Potent limitations of that viewpoint despite the fact that it's given us tremendous power and the limitations are essentially as follows the essential materialist view can't tell us anything about consciousness which is probably the primary fact of experience neuroscientists in recent years mostly in the last decade of being trying to crack the problem of consciousness and they have absolutely made no progress they've tried to associate consciousness with neuronal activity but that seems to be an incomplete answer because there's many forms of neuronal activity in the brain that aren't accompanied by consciousness at all not only do neuroscientists understand virtually nothing about consciousness they can't even really figure out what it's function is they can't understand why our brains would go to so much effort to make us aware of things when it isn't clear at all that awareness is necessary for life especially given that there are many life forms on the planet that don't seem to be aware at all the standard material is view is also insufficient many other ways it's insufficient philosophically i think as you probably all know because a conception that portrays the world is made up of objects is in some really fundamental way dad and it doesn't seem to have a place in it for human beings or a place in it for meaning or a mode whereby you might be able to conceptualize the real existence of something like an emotion or a dream or a motivation all phenomena which are just as mysterious to neuroscience in general has consciousness now the problem with this seems to be mostly experiential if you have to ask people what they know more than anything else they know number one that their conscious they know number two that they're internal experiential life is composed of emotions and motivational states which although not rational in essential structure are so real and relevant that virtually everything that people do is predicated on them so our current viewpoint despite its ability to give us tremendous technological power seems to eradicate from formal consideration many many essential experiences that are vital to life in fact even perhaps primary no i'm going to suggest you today that there is an alternative viewpoint and i think also it's one that although you may be hearing about it formally for the first time is also something that you know unbelievably deeply how thousands of years ago plato proposed that all knowledge was remembering and of course we don't believe that today because we believe we gather knowledge as a consequence of contact with the world but you'll see today that the knowledge that i'm going to share with you will strike a deep chord of remembering and it's because everything that you've done throughout your life is in one way or another predicated on what i'm going to tell you today i'm going to demonstrate this in a peculiar way i think because i'm going to start by telling you a story and the reason i'm going to do that is because models of the world that include phenomena like consciousness and emotions and motivations and actions and interactions are generally portrayed formally in stories and not in scientific theories and it does turn out to be that stories themselves have an identifiable structure even a grammar that makes them comprehensible furthermore it turns out that even the simplest stories especially if they're elegantly constructed have an unbelievably profound underlying meaning and you can frequently see this most particularly in children story so i remember i showed my son when he was 4 years old the disney movie pinocchio which on the surface of it is a very strange tale right it's a wooden puppet who wants to become real so he has to rescue his father from the belly of a whale a structure that could by no means be considered rational that is in fact so surprising and unexpected that it's remarkable to imagine that grown men and women including children can sit in a movie theater and watch a story like that unfold without ever thinking for a second that it's absolutely peculiar that they can be taken in by such a tail and regard it experientially as real.
Pinocchio is a deep deep story it has echoes that go back 3 or 4000 years to the earliest stories that we know and it's so rich with information that a child can watch it over and over and over and over i think my son wants pinocchio 30 times a why well it's either because a child can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality or it's because there's something to those stories that's much more potent than we actually consciously understand it's kind of interesting too you know if you go to a video rental establishment you'll find that in the top 10 highest grossing movies of all time are four disney movies that are animated fairy tales essentially retelling of mythological stories they strike a deep chord why shakespeare was of course a great literary figure set it perhaps better than anyone else has which is not surprising because he said many things better than anyone else has he said all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts and so following from that you can imagine that a story is no more about the props in the world than a play that you go see is about the props on the stage a drama is about the man in which people actually exist the emotions that they feel the motivational states they encounter the problems they have to solve when they interact with each other and the plays the thing from that particular perspective in which we can capture those aspects of our experience that are not only real but essentially human i'm going to tell you a little story to begin this off with it's a kid's story written for children of about 4 years of age but it's very very elegant i tried to cut it down for this talk but i found i couldn't because it was so well edited that every single piece of it how to fit into make the story complete and i'm going to show you first the structure of the story now this is a very useful diagram in many ways it's very simple basically it says this whenever you're doing anything you inhabit a bounded world now you know like for example you're sitting here in this lecture there's things you are paying attention to when things you're not if i took most of you out of this room right now and asked you.
Definitively what colour the rug was you wouldn't know or what colour your chair was for example or what the person next to you was wearing and blessed that person happens to be your husband or your wife you wouldn't remember any of those things and the reason for that is when you're in a situation like this and you're attending to a speaker most of the occurrences that are unfolding around you are irrelevant you don't store them you only focus on certain things well how do you decide what to focus on giving that there is virtually unlimited number of things to pay attention to well you have to conceive of yourself as being somewhere always and you have to conceive of yourself is going somewhere so you could say in in a real sense the world you inhabit is a journey it's a journey from point a to point b a journey from what is to what should be a journey from the place you are which is insufficient in some important manner to a place that in some important manner is going to be better a standard story has exactly that structure child comes home and you say well what happened to you today on the way to school setting up the little narrative structure and the child unfold the sequence of events that he encountered if the stories more interesting than just a recount of exactly what happened to it usually involves the encounter with something unexpected on the way to point b and a description of the manner in which that encounter with the unexpected was resolved typical story now why would you want to know that why would you want to listen to it well it's because on your journey from point a to point b all sorts of unexpected things always happen and if someone else is encountered something unexpected and conjured up a decent solution to it it could well be worth your time to listen.
Well maybe there's a pattern to encountering unexpected things maybe there's a proper way to encounter the unexpected maybe it's the case that in our collective wisdom as human beings we've gathered up representations of ways to encounter the unexpected that we put forth in our stories how should you face what you don't understand.
For a moment from a different perspective and see if you can imagine exactly what it is that it says there's no such thing as a dragon.
Well we all know that rated dragon is a fictitious creature reptilian terrible lives forever breathes fire.
Strange combination of attributes why would something terrible an ancient called a treasure billy bixby was rather surprised when he woke up one morning and found a dragon in his room there was a small dragon about the size of a kitten the dragon wagged its tail happily when billy padded its head interesting you know in chinese mythology dragon is a positive figure in european mythology the dragon is something to face in combat and destroy or something to face in combat and build something out of the pieces left over from the dragon.
Cluttering up the world's order and the reason she got sensitive to that as a child was because children are really really dependent on order right i mean and the reason for that is that their realm of competence is rather restricted so they like to see things messed up so little kids for example they're not happy with you if you play a game with them and then mess around with the rules of the game they don't like that at all they think that that's immoral activity to shake up the structure of the game well anyways well she was pondering all this she came into our bedroom one night and said dad i had a nightmare now we all know right nightmares aren't real just like dragons dreams aren't real of course which raises the question of why in the world you bother having them 6 or 7 hours a night every single day of your life and why they're a recognised feature of animal behaviour all the way down to the amphibian level she said i dreamt that there was a clear flowing stream but in the stream there was all sorts of garbage and it's scared me and bothered me so much i woke up so i told her look close your eyes and imagine the stream it's full of garbage what should you do about it she said well i should take the garbage out of the street and i said all right so picture the stream picture yourself cleaning the garbage out of it she calm down and went back to sleep why well because dreams concentrate on threat we know that they present threats to you threats you haven't been able to deal with well there's a part of your brain that tracks threats and it's not really all that smart in some ways all it does is say look here's the problem and it's waiting for the rest of your brain to conjure up some solution that problem and if it doesn't conjure up a solution then it just presents the problem over and over and over and over and over so people who have post-traumatic stress disorder for example who've been really upset by their contact with something unexpected dream about the same tragedy forever until they solve it and they solve it by facing it and living it over and over voluntarily so you might think right off the bat from listening to that little story that suggesting to your 4 year old daughter who's just had a nightmare that her fears aren't real and that the dream representation of them isn't real because it's not tangible like a table might not really be the best approach to the problem so you see billy he's pretty much got it right right off the bat write the dragon wagged its tail happily when billy padded its head billy went downstairs to tell his mother there's no such thing as a dragon said billy's mother and she said it like she meant it tell there's a dragon in this house now the next thing you might wonder is how often have you actually going into a house where there's a dragon my guess is if you don't take this particularly specifically and allow yourself to use your imagination and to think metaphorically for a moment you've all encountered dozens of houses that were filled right to the rafters with various dragons all of which were being studiously ignored by the people who inhabited the house billy went back to his room and began to dress the dragon came close to billy in a friendly manner and wagged its tail but billy didn't pat it if there's no such thing as something it's silly to padded on the head billy wash his face and hands and went down to breakfast the dragon went along it was bigger now almost the size of a dog billy sat down at the table the dragon sat down on the table this sort of thing was not usually permitted but there wasn't much billy's mother could do about it she'd already said there was no such thing as a dragon and if there's no such thing you can't tell it to get down off the table sometimes i sit with friends of mine who are very young children to eat say and the children two or three years old don't sit at the table they sit on the table or they run around the table or they run around the table and pull things off the table or they run around the house and pull things off all the shelves in the house and keep their parents so busy chasing them around that they have no time whatsoever to interact as adults well you have to wonder under those circumstances whether you're dealing with a child or a dragon so to speak and you also might wonder whether or not the dragon is large and unruly precisely because the parents are completely unwilling to admit that it actually exists mother made some pancakes for billy put the dragon eat them all mother made some more but the dragon ain't those two mother kept making pancakes until she ran out of batter billy only got one of them but he said that's all he really wanted anyway one time.
An acquaintance of ours in boston brought their son over to be babysat at our house and his nanny had just been in a car accident so he was being shunted from house to house while his parents went off to work and he didn't have very good reputation this kid he was about 4 and.
He came over to our house and with his mother in the morning and she dropped him off and she said.
Dragon associated with this child that happens to be interviewing perhaps with his ability to eat so i came back at noon my wife had taken care of the children not day and i walked in the house and the other four or five kids that we had in the house we're off playing and this little kid was standing in the corner like really isolated and looking you know upset fundamentally so i went over and i poked him a bunch because generally if you poke a kid a little bit you know while they go like this you know that sort of back off but sooner or later you can crack them and they'll smile and then they'll play not this kid boy there's no bloody way he's going to play with me and that was that like he'd already learnt that adults should either be ignored or that they were trouble and he wasn't going to let any adult into his little world so there was absolutely a dragon associated with that little boy and it was eating all his pancakes billy went upstairs to brush his teeth mother started clearing the table the dragon who was quite as big as mother by this time made himself comfortable on the whole rug it went to sleep i really like this one by the time billy came back downstairs too fast said billy there's no such thing as a dragon said mother firmly cleaning the downstairs took mother all morning what was the dragon in the way and having to climb in and out of windows to get from room to room so you know you think back in your own experience when you've gone to a house where there's a dragon hiding underneath the living room rug and nobody's saying anything about it and then you think how long does it take to get something absolutely simple done in a house that's absolutely jammed to the rafters with unfinished business forever right organising people in a household like that to even do something as simple as go out for breakfast in the morning or even perhaps to make a meal is virtually impossible why well because there's something going on in the household that has been studiously ignored for a very long time and has grown so large as a consequence that it occupies the whole domain.
Are you in the dragon filled the house it's head hang out the front door it's tail hang out the back door and there wasn't a room in the house that didn't have some part of the dragon in it when the dragon to walk from his nap he was hungry the bakery truck went by the smell of fresh bread was more than the dragon could resist he ran down the street after the bakery truck the house went along of course like the shell on a snail the mailman was just coming up the path with some mail for the bixby's when their house rush passed him and headed down the street he chased the bixby's house for a few blocks but he but he couldn't catch it when mr bixby came home for lunch the first thing he noticed was that his house was gone luckily one of the neighbors was able to tell him which way it went you know that sort of thing happens to people not in frequently too right they're not really looking around march at what's going on and they come home from work one day and their house is gone and what does that mean well maybe there.
Children have become completely alienated from them or maybe their wife has decided suddenly but of course not so suddenly to leave why.
Million mrs bixby were waving from an upstairs window in the 1890s in india when a house was being built the local.
Priest equivalent to the priest would come by to set the foundation stone and when you set the foundation stone he take a big spike and drove it into the ground and the reason he drove it into the ground at the place where the foundation was going to be laid was to keep the great dragon that is underneath the earth firmly pinned down by its head so it couldn't move and shake the house to bits what does that mean well it means the same thing that's meant in the new testament when you're told not to build your house on a foundation of sand right doesn't matter how good the house is or how well constructed it is or how rich it is if the foundation is made out of sand or if it rests on top of a dragon there's nothing in that household that's ever going to be accomplished that's positive and the wealthy display that the house might consist of is nothing but a sham mr bixby climbed over the dragon's head onto the porch roof and through the upstairs window how did this happen mr bixby asked it was the dragon said billy there's no such thing mother started to say there is a dragon billy insisted a very big dragon and billy padded the dragon on the head the dragon wagged its tail happily then even faster than it had grown the dragon started getting smaller again why did it have to grow so big i'm not sure i said billy but i think it just wanted to be noticed so the first thing you might think about is just what happens if you don't pay a bill like really don't pay it right i mean when it first comes in it's only the size of a kitten but if you leave it alone for 2 or 3 years it pretty much grows into a full-fledged dragon why well because things that you ignore have a life of their own complex life like a bill bills attached to a whole industrial complex right one of who's major functions is to make sure that you pay the bill and if you don't pay the bill then you immediately find out what it's connected to it's connected to something immense and very troublesome and if you allow the full force of that thing to manifest itself it's not pretty so one lesson from this story is that if something's.
Nagging at you just a bit.
It's probably better to deal with it before it turns into a full-fledged dragon and then you might think well what if it's already a full-fledged dragon right i mean then what's your option is there's nothing left but to run away and so then i can tell you what we know from 50 years of studying the outcome of clinical psychological interventions so let's take an extreme case right let's say something truly terrible has happened to you and as a consequence of that you're in shock post-traumatic shock which is a condition that sufficiently serious to damage your brain over time it's not only a psychological disorder it's a physical disorder if you really stressed your cortisol level shoot up and if your cortisol level shoot up that cortisol and high doses is a neurotoxin starts to damage your brain so let's take a very extreme case and imagine that you've been violently sexually assaulted and has a consequence of that you're in post-traumatic shock how do you get cured so that means you can't really go outside you certainly can encounter anything that's associated with the event your sense of integrity and personal safety is being completely destroyed is there any way you can get back on your feet in new york i think one of the world's top clinical psychologists and she's been dealing with women who have post traumatic stress disorder for a decades and she's found.
A treatment that works.
As much detail as possible over and over in the imagination with the accompanying emotion and she's found because she's done physiological measurements on her clients that those women that allow themselves to get the most fully upset as a consequence of the reliving get better faster and stay better longer the clinical evidence is absolutely clear when you take someone to therapy or basically doing two things to them well three you allow them to confess what's wrong with them because it's really useful to actually say what it is that's clear and distinct.
And you have to know where you're going because otherwise there's no structure for your life.
If your path from point a to b is being blocked by something that you're afraid of you better learn to confront it because if you don't it will grow and expand until it turns into the kind of dragon that occupies your whole house.
This is another representation of a story that's a simple story i think it's one that's really most applicable to children.
There are aspects of it that are most applicable to children sexual desire when obviously isn't it's a map of motivation and basically says this and it's easy to understand if you think you're the movie doesn't matter what country it's made there's certain things that always happen right like two broad classes of fiction adventure and romance what's an adventure to go to new lands and discover something new and become transformed as a consequence what's a romance to meet another person who certainly is complicated as anything you could meet on an adventure and again to be transformed as a consequence of the contact to fundamental plots why why are there fundamental plots and why can we understand them without them being explained to us what's because fundamentally we're all very very similar we have a finite set of basic needs so for example hot people would rather be cool thirsty people would rather have water hungry people would rather eat and these motivations colour what we conceive of as our ultimate destiny so in the old testament for example an agrarian community often hungry paradise was construed as the land of milk and honey well why well milk is high in fat and honey is high in glucose and if you're hungry really hungry there's nothing you want more than fat and sugar.
Affiliate of desire we like to be around other people sexual desire a fundamental sub element of a romantic plot these underlying motivational systems of ours set us up bounded world within which we live so for example if you fall in love with someone and you construe your destiny as being with them any indication that they're pleased with you is going to produce a rash of positive emotion why because our emotional systems are set up so that any sign that we're moving towards our goal is responded to with a rush of positive emotion and conversely a frown from the person that you love especially in the initial ages of initial stages of a romance is met with a flood of negative affect why.
Because anything that stops us on the path that we've chosen produces negative emotion that's how we're set up an emotional systems are actually quite straightforward we pause it a goal the thing about people is that we can pause it virtually anything as a goal that's one of the things that distinguishes us from animals so we can all be thrilled to death when our favourite soccer team scores a goal because we participate in what they're doing the same way we participate in watching a protagonist on a movie or in a book we can feel it we embody it we even know now that the neural systems that i utilise to watch a movie involve the same neural systems that the actor is utilising acting out the part so when you say you understand someone else what do you mean is your body is set to do exactly the same thing their body is and your emotional systems are locked on exactly the same way there is our so when they experienced something in your watching it you experience an echo of it and that's what understanding means and it turns out as well that those neural systems that allow us to embody someone else and to imitate them are right underneath the structures that we've evolved to use for language and what that indicates is that mostly what we use language for is to tell stories to tell stories about the way that people act so that we can derive information not about what the world's made of cuz we don't really care about that some fundamental way but instead how should we act that's the fundamental question how should we act now if you go see a movie about a thug the message there is given that the thug generally comes to not so good and don't act like a thug write interesting though it might be compelling as a lifestyle at least sufficiently compelling so you're watch it it's not a good long-term strategy what is a good long term strategy you know we've been collecting stories as people we don't know how long really we don't know 100,000 years maybe there's been creatures like us indistinguishable from us for $100,000 years and we know that societies that appear to be more or less as archaic as those old societies tell stories have rituals have mythology we have ancient written stories like the new man list which is a sumerian story the oldest written story we have 4000 years old based on a oral tradition that's probably 20000 years older than that we've been collecting stories for a long long time what do they mean what are they good for all imagine this you know you tell a story to your husband or your wife but something interesting that you saw right well then imagine that you could collect a thousand of the most interesting stories and then imagine that you were some kind of literary genius like like shakespeare and you can take those thousand interesting stories and boil them down to 100 really interesting stories and then imagine that you had 10000 years to gather up those 100 most interesting stories and average them and you can come out with one perfect story the best story the most interesting story that you could possibly tell that's what i meant is the most interesting story you can possibly tell and just as this little story that i just told you had an underlying mythological structure virtually every story you ever see has such a structure that's why it's compelling to you and when you meet someone who's charismatic or who holds your attention or who you're interested in the probability that they're acting out a mythological fragment is very very high and that's why it is that your attention is captivated by them what's the world like from this perspective we'll look you know you're all sitting in this room you think if i took you out of here how would you describe it was full of chairs there was a table lights well why would you pick that level of resolution like why wouldn't you say well you know the average ceiling tile had about 15,000 dots on it doesn't seem like a relevant data point right you say the same thing about the rod there's no nothing stopping you from counting the number of stains or the number of red spots or the way the light plays off your partner's shirt or the shine on your shoes and if you were an artist say i'm trying to make a representation of this room you'd concentrate on aspects of the word completely different from those that you're concentrating on now you talk about chairs tv cameras cabinets tables why their functional their objects right they're tools they're tools they're things you can use normally when you're going from point a to point b you divide up the world into things you can use those are things you see your perceptual systems do this things you can use and things that might get in the way and as you move from motivated world to motivated world the little stories that you inhabit you drop the world up in different pieces so a piano for a concert pianist is different as a different phenomena than a piano for someone who has no musical education but you're always passing up the world in terms of what it's good for how it can serve your purposes and you even see it that way now the question is.
How do you parse up the world into things that are useful to you like chairs the complicated question is what do you do when something that you don't expect happens so imagine you've had a 15-year long marriage and you find lipstick on your husband's caller not once but three times and then you think well.
Structure of interpretation but i find that there's some aspect of his apparent behaviour it's completely outside my scope of interpretation what do you do while you can choose to ignore that right it's easy to do that why would you not why would you ignore it because if you don't ignore it you have to think.
Really really complicated and if they're not who you think they are you have no idea who they might be and you also might think well maybe i'm not who i think i am because after all i got sucked into this situation i thought i'd pretty much understood the world and turns out that i certainly don't understand the opposite gender and there's some indication that i really don't even understand myself because fundamentally i'm so clueless and then you might think well when did this start this cluelessness how long have i been blind we'll do you really want to ask that question well not generally right it's easy to keep the dragon in the closet which is where it tends to live.
What happens when you encounter something you don't expect for a long time psychologist thought the people learnt fear right so you're typical person your typical lab rat was a common creature now it's a funny thing and because if you take a lab rat out of his home cage and you put them in a new cage where you want to teach them say to be afraid of something to be afraid of a light paired with a shock which is a typical psychological experiment the funny thing about the rat is he got to let him calm down before he's normal well except that you might think that the not comrade is also the normal route right you take the rat out of his cage and you put them in the new cage and what does he do he goes like this why well he's a rat right someone might eat them so he's a bit nervous about being in this new situation rats do not like being a new situation they don't like bright light if you put them in a new situation that's brightly lit they go right over to the corner because they think maybe cats won't find them rats are so afraid of cats that they never even have to meet a cat to be afraid of them so you can take a rat that's never seen a cat in his life and if you let him smell some cat older or show him a cat he'll tell you if you show a route a cat somewhere he doesn't expect it he will run back to his borough and scream for 24 hours are you mad at how scared you'd have to be to scream for 24 hours especially given the rattle he lives about a year so that would be for you like screaming i'll be like screaming for 3 months right back to his girl and he screams and every other rat who hears him scream freezers and they all stay like that for 24 hours till they sort of calm down and then the first thing they do is they go back to the place where they saw the cat and they start to map it out so they do these things called corner runs which is so the rat wants to go back to this territory knows the territory might be a place where he gets food is the cat still there what you might think stay in the barrel right but then maybe you don't get something to eat so the rat goes back to the place where the cat was carefully and then he hunches down and he runs over part of it and if nothing kills them then he goes back and does the same thing with a little more of the territory until finally the rats have run all over the territory again then they go back to eating making love paying attention to their families are quite social despite the fact that they're rats the rats might have to go back to the scene of the crime so to speak right it's not going to let the dragon that might be there grow the rat knows that if something is terrifying it should be investigated not run away from.
The question is what are you encounter when you encounter something you don't expect and so you say well you've got your spouse mapped out right but then they do something you don't expect which hopefully happens fairly regularly right because otherwise you get bored with them they do something you don't expect who is that person precisely and what that means is that what what that means is that when you encounter something unexpected you actually can't see what's there why because it's too complicated you might have to spend a month talking to your spouse to figure out just exactly why they have that particular peculiar opinion you have to explore and dig to find out how they map the world if you encounter something unexpected the first thing you see is not the world the first thing you see is just a sense of discomfort and fear combined with some latent curiosity that the world is not the way you thought it was now how do you find out what the world is actually like we have to investigate it you have to investigate it means you have to take a risk you have to move forward the same way that people do in psychotherapy you have to find the thing that you're bordering on avoiding and going in map it now it's curious thing you know.
Time and anxiety disorders agoraphobia agoraphobia is a generalised anxiety disorder and people who suffer severely from agoraphobia often get to the point where because of their panax their housebound they can't go outside their room or their house now they run away from the room or their house too if they could but there's nowhere to run so they're pretty much stuck being somewhere so.
20 ft that's max i said okay let's go up to 20 feet there and i may do that and then you let them stand there and stand there and stand there and stand there and stand there sooner later they get bored of being 20 feet from the elevator and then you say we'll look you know let's could you go 10 ft no i couldn't go 10 ft that's too close how about could you go three more feet yeah i think i could do that so they go three more feet and then he let them stand there and they find out nothing terrible is happening sooner or later and then they go another three feet and then they go another three feet and then they're they're like confronting the elevator and then they're inside the elevator but they're going like this because they don't want to look at the elevator right so you say wow you got to look at the elevator you look at the numbers step by step.
Sooner or later and usually sooner bang they've gone up a floor right so then what happens.
Let's go home and have a fight with her husband that's been brewing for like 15 years why well it's not because the elevator symbolically related to the fight has nothing to do with it it's because what the person learns in the combat with the unknown which just happens to be taking the guise of an elevator is that they can confront things that frighten them without being destroyed by the confrontation and so what you see immediately and this was contrary to an original psychoanalytic prediction is that man you know you take that person out you teach them they can go in the elevator and right off the bat they're going to shopping malls they're in taxis they're back in the subway and they're standing up for themselves at home generalisation why because they didn't learn that the elevator wasn't frightening that isn't what they learned they learnt that despite the fact that the elevator was this terrifying as anything they've ever encountered they were actually up to the challenge and now that's a really useful thing to teach someone right because if you have an obsessive compulsive patient i had one who actually used to work with radiation he was terrible he worked in some kind of biolab in montreal people with obsessive compulsive disorder often very frightened if they'll contaminate someone else so like typical obsessive compulsive obsession would be all go to a shopping market i'll touch some fruit from you know some third world country i'll get some nasty bacterial disease i'll bring it home and i'll give it to my kids well you tell them look you know the chances of that are like 1 and 150000 i don't care if the chances are only 150000 what if my kids die anything well yeah that does pose a problem doesn't it because it isn't exactly clear from a logical perspective where you should draw the risk line.
That sounds good theory but what if something really terrible happened to you well what's happened dad in the forest patience that's up there and with terrible right i mean that's up there with terrible right stripped of social dignity violated physically that combines two of people's most specific fears well then there's other kinds of confrontation to it i like the story of souls and it's and i think it's really a good one because there's different kinds of dragons like death and disease and then there's social dragons like bureaucracies and tyrannies alexander so it's an epson you may or may not know as a prisoner in the soviet gulag concentration camp system that by his report at least killed 60 million people between 1919 and 1959 right 60 million that's 10 times as many as hitler killed at least with regards to the genocide 60 million people on the russian front which was a nasty place to be then he was captured by the germans so they didn't like russians so they put them in separate prisoners of war camp partly because stellen who is the consummate paranoid wouldn't sign the geneva convention on the treatment of prisoners of war so the german setup extra po w camps for the russians and they starve generally so badly that if other pou w is were in the vicinity they throw food packages over the wire even though they themselves weren't particularly well fed.
They were contaminated by their exposure to the western economic system and as a consequence of that they posed a threat to the integrity of the soviet states so he just threw them all in concentration camps so fine so soon it's been sitting there in this concentration camp on a call pile a call pile which contained this kind of clay that his compatriots would eat because they were so damn hungry that it was better to have the clay and their stomach the nothing at all and he thought all right.
What the hell did i do to get here which is really a remarkable thing to think right because like there was the second world war and that probably couldn't be pen directly on him and then there's stalin who was you know really one of the world's worst monsters and then there's the concentration camp and the pow camp and like a lot of things happen to social nets and but he said he had nothing but time to think in this concentration camp and he wasn't really that happy with the way things turned out so he made a vow in the camp in the vow is this he said he's going to go back over his whole life whole life right from day one and try to remember every time he ever did something he thought was wrong he thought right not someone else but that gave his conscience a pain.
Little knots in my soul that i tied and the consequence of that was that he wrote a book called the gulag archipelago write three volume book 1900 pages long he memorised it because there wasn't any paper in pennsylvania.
And then it circulated in the underground in the soviet union for years before it got published in the west published 1975 definitely one of the literary events that brought down the soviet union say that's kind of interesting isn't it take this one guy right it's got numbers tattooed on his arm he's a skinny as a rail he's 3/4 dead he's been beat to death in 15 different ways he decides under completely unreasonable circumstances that he's going to take personal responsibility for the position that he happens to find himself in the consequence of that 25 years later is that soldier nets and still around but the soviet union isn't and you think well that can't be the way the world works now can it but then you think this too like do we really know how the world works right we've had a pretty nasty century in the last 100 years right we had the nazis we had mild stung we had the recent tragedies in africa we don't seem to learn anything about genocide someone like sores in its and says well you know.
Might be your fault.
Why what are you ignoring.
Good question can you make peace with your own family it's not so easy right it's probably no easier than making peace between the israelis and the palestinians what are we encounter when we encounter something we don't understand.
It's not the simple world of objects the simple world of objects is something we've learnt to see the real world is way more complicated than what we just see let me give you an example.
When i was in montreal 1985 my computer crashed.
When a computer encounter something unexpected it crashes it can't do it damn thing about it you have to fix it so i check the monitor it was okay i wouldn't go on seemed all right.
The traffic lights were off right the whole city was in darkness then i found out the next day that there was a solar wind.
Big solar flare put out a big cloud of electrons zipped along to earth at the speed of light put an electrical pulse through the hydroelectric red and quebec crash my computer.
Well i hadn't thought until that point that the integrity of my computer was dependent on the stability of the sun everything is way more complicated than it looks and when you just look at something you see a very simple representation of what's actually there what do you encounter when you encounter something unexpected.
But it makes you curious think dragons right every primates afraid of lizards including us chimpanzees don't like snakes if you take a champ it's never seen a snake you throw a short a snake it will hit the roof of its cage then it'll look at the snake why would a dragon hoard gold does a dragon represents everything that you're afraid of what's embedded in everything that you're afraid of.
Absolutely everything that you need to find run from what you're afraid of run from exactly what you need to find.
What are the oldest dramatic representations we know of not the specific painting this is st george and the dragon right dragon lives in the ground.
Chase there by heroes of previous generation.
Now and then re-emerging.
Threatens the integrity of the community like everything unexpected does.
Hero comes out.
Slave the dragon.
Freeze the treasure in this case it's a virtual woman.
Dragon's horde gold because.
Parents were divorced.
So they were dragons in the house.
Who is about 4 at this time is run around the house with his little plastic knight helmet on and a sword is zipping around killing things with it doing this all the time and even when he went to sleep at night he'd put the sword by his pillow and the knight helmet on his pill now every night or every second night or every third night for 6 months he'd been waking up screaming now why well he was about to go to kindergarten right so that's that's a real threshold for maternal dependence fundamentally into the real world that's.
That's a new thing but also there was upset in his house.
Dwarfs kill one big deal 10 more common i said what can you do about that now in a legal trial that would have been an inadmissible question right that's called leading the witness because what i told him was despite the horror of this situation you maybe could do something about it and he said ha i take my sword i get my dad that's a good idea right dad there's the real dad and then there's the tradition dad right you might as well have your father by your side if you're going to go into battle i take my sword i get my dad i go to where the dragon was i jump up on his head i poked both of his eyes out with the sword i'd go down his throat to the place where the fire comes out i cut a piece of that box out and i'd use it as a shield and i thought wow that's unbelievable unbelievable that he could do that it's perfect right there's no sense going after the dwarfs of them you might as well go after the dragon.
A piece that can defend you against anything including other dragons so what if this was the case think.
Evolutionarily speaking or religiously speak what if we were adapted to the world now what if it's not the simple place of dead objects that we think it is what if it's something a lot more alive a lot more like a story what if the story is something like this.
You have absolutely everything you need.
But you have to use all of it if you run away from any of it and in particular the parts of it that frighten you which you know there's endless reasons to run away from if you run away from any of it you don't get that piece of the dragon if you miss even one piece there's a chink in your armor there's a place where you're vulnerable if you make even one mistake you lessen yourself if you lessen yourself you can run away more not only that when someone wants to lean on you then i'll be able to lean on you cuz you'll just fall over what if it was the case that we were adapted to the world really adapted to it so that if we made full use of all the talents we had we'd be okay what if it was the case that if we set out consciously to never run away from something we know we shouldn't run away from that everything would be alright.
You can think whatever you want to think but this is what i think i think it's bloody amazing that that little kids book that i read you at the beginning of this lecture had all that information in it and so you might ask yourself when you leave if that information isn't true how the hell did it get there.
